Bob, the used car salesman, went to work on
Tuesday morning. A customer walks into his shop
and says, "I want to buy a car!" A usual day as always for
Bob. Bob says to him, "we have all the cars you can ask for, fast
slow, luxury, cheap. What are you looking for?". The customer replies,
"I want a sports car for cheap, can you hook me up?"...

Bob cocks his head and looks at the customer inquisitively.
Finally, Bob replies "No".
"But why not?" cries the customer, visually confused now.
Before Bob even got the chance to reply, the real car salesman
came running out to the lot from the building, yelling to the customer
that Bob is in fact an imposter who comes to the lot regularly with
intent to inhibit the dealership's business.

Bob looks at the car salesmen and ran away
Bob runs into the car and opens the door
He turned the key and drove off
Bob was never seen again

Until the following day, that is.
Wednesday morning, a another customer enters
the shop in search of an affordable car.
A familiar looking man greets the customer-
inquiring about their needs. The salesman
succeeds in finalizing the sale, but as it turns
out, this man was Bob! The store owner comes out
afterward. Recognizing that Bob just conducted excellent
business, he offers him a job. Bob now has a promising
career in the sales industry and no longer has to resort to 
his usual antics.
